# Cohort0
this repo holds the work for the capstone project 



# 👩‍💼 Scenario:
You've just been promoted to Lead Developer at Cookie Corp, a company famous for its delicious and imaginative cookies. Your first mission? To create the most irresistible cookie-clicker game ever, using the magic of Kubernetes! But here's the twist: Cookie Corp is new to the world of Kubernetes, and they're a bit hesitant. They're giving you just one cluster for your proof of concept.



# 🤖 The Twist:
There's a catch, though. Your organization is still on the fence about Kubernetes, a bit skeptical about its magic. They've decided to test the waters by allocating just one cluster for your project. It's your chance to not only build an amazing game but also to showcase the potential and efficiency of Kubernetes.


# 🌟 Your Goal:
This is more than just a project; it's your opportunity to shine and convince your organization of the true capabilities of Kubernetes. Your task is to utilize this single cluster to its fullest potential, ensuring that your cookie-clicker game is not only fun and captivating but also a testament to the power of Kubernetes as a scalable and efficient platform for deployment.
